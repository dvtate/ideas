MP4 has a few different types of frames
1. Re-draw the entire frame
2. Update parts of frame that moved and keep the rest
3. Some other stuff idk about

To get desired effect just remove #1 and keep 2+3, and should be wild looking video.

would like this to be a filter for special effects in videos
