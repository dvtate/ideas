# wishlist
Some project ideas I'd work on if I had more freetime/motivation. See other `.md` files and the lists below for specs and ideas.

## Useful Software
- Self-hosted alternative to Google photos
- Translate code comments to English (ie - vscode translator extension)
- Automated tool that helps you migrate your code from github to codeberg or some other git hosting platform not owned by M$
- Convert this a github repo into a website that lets people contribute their own ideas and maybe add bounties too
- Chrome/firefix console for node.js so you can inspect complex objects
- Guestlist widget for website that has actual world map for where people live
- Preprocessor for TypeScript
- JavaScript library which converts objects into graphviz dot format
  - Even better if it would have a dropdown which lets you explore the objects' internals
- ifttt + scratch
- WebRTC IPC
- github orphanage: for archived projects, also maybe open issue project asking maintainers why they archived it
- birdmonitors.net mobile app
- wasm linker
- extract media files from Twitter archive
- Tinder for e-dating (ie - browser extension to highlight single users of social media sites)

## Useless but Interesting/fun\[ny]
- Twitter bot that qrt "btw i use arch" every time someone mentions linux or arch linux
- OS that's just conway's game of life
  - WiP: https://github.com/dvtate/conway-os
- [anti-spellcheck](https://twitter.com/hoffridder/status/1362180211392065536): underlines words that are spelled correctly and gives most common mispellings
- `diff` except it always just says the entire file changed
- Shopping carts with turn signals; grocery stores with traffic signs+lights
- Program which creates animation where one plant turns into a network of plants via asexual reproduction. Inputs: list of coordinates

## Games
- Chemical factory game
- Racing game with an elo-system
- [man vs tree](https://twitter.com/caravanmalice/status/1544819658980659200)

## Maybe Hardware?
- Add reservation/scheduling system for important equiptment (could be app but more lame)
- pill calendar that doesn't need reloading
- Water gun to spray washable paint on cars who drive through pedestrian crossway
