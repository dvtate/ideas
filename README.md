# wishlist
Some project ideas I'd work on if I had more freetime/motivation. See other `.md` files and the lists below for specs and ideas.

## Useful Software
- Microsoft excel but with a better way to extend functionality 
- WASM linker: probably difficult because tables
- Translate code comments to English (ie - vscode translator extension)
- Automated tool that helps you migrate your code from github to codeberg or some other git hosting platform not owned by M$
- Convert this a github repo into a website that lets people contribute their own ideas and maybe add bounties too
- Preprocessor for TypeScript
- JavaScript library which converts objects into graphviz dot format
- Guest list widget for website that has actual world map
- extract media files from Twitter archive
- Tinder for e-dating (ie - browser extension to highlight single users on social media)
- self-hostable version of [gemfury.com](https://gemfury.com)
- GitHub but for CC media. Like Wikimedia but searchable.
- Use ChatGPT, speech recognition and TTS to wait and interact with customer service on your behalf
- Server logging system which sends a message to sysadmin via Telegram or their preferred IM.

## Useless but Interesting/fun\[ny]
- Twitter bot that qrt "btw i use arch" every time someone mentions linux or arch linux
- `diff` except it always just says the entire file changed
- Shopping carts with turn signals; grocery stores with traffic signs+lights
- Program which creates animation where one plant turns into a network of plants via asexual reproduction. Inputs: list of coordinates
- digital sliderule

## Games
- Chemical factory game
- Racing game with an elo-system
- [man vs tree](https://twitter.com/caravanmalice/status/1544819658980659200)

## Maybe Hardware?
- Add reservation/scheduling system for important equiptment (could be app but more lame)
- pill calendar that doesn't need reloading
- Water gun to spray washable paint on cars who drive through pedestrian crossway

# Big Ideas/Startups
These aren't trivial to do but could be revolutionary if done well.
- ifttt + scratch

## Done/WiP
- OS that's just conway's game of life
  - WiP: https://github.com/dvtate/conway-os
- [anti-spellcheck](https://twitter.com/hoffridder/status/1362180211392065536): underlines words that are spelled correctly and gives most common mispellings
- Self-hosted alternative to Google photos
  - currently using nextcloud and reasonably happy with it.
- WebRTC IPC
  - The WebRTC spec is so incredibly cursed that at this point I'd just recommend that people use [peerjs](https://github.com/peers/peerjs).
- Chrome/firefox console for node.js so you can inspect complex objects
  - Saw this somewhere, not super important for me rn
- github orphanage: for archived projects, also maybe open issue project asking maintainers why they archived it
