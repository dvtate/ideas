# wishlist
Some project ideas I'd work on if I had free time. See other `.md` files and the lists below for ideas

## Useful
- Automated tool that helps you migrate your code from github to codeberg or some other git hosting platform not owned by M$
- Convert this a github repo into a website that lets people contribute their own ideas
- Chrome/firefix console for node.js so you can inspect complex objects

## Cool But useless
- Twitter bot that qrt "btw i use arch" every time someone mentions linux or arch linux
- OS that's just conway's game of life
