# wishlist
Some project ideas I'd work on if I had free time. See other `.md` files and the lists below for ideas

## Useful
- Automated tool that helps you migrate your code from github to codeberg or some other git hosting platform not owned by M$
- Convert this a github repo into a website that lets people contribute their own ideas
- Chrome/firefix console for node.js so you can inspect complex objects
- Guestlist widget for website that has actual world map for where people live

## Cool But useless
- Twitter bot that qrt "btw i use arch" every time someone mentions linux or arch linux
- OS that's just conway's game of life

## \[Bad] Startup ideas
- Tinder for e-dating
- Ransomware "insurance" - team to reinstall & recover everything (ie - for factories)
- Like wikipedia but for news
- Racing game with proper elo-system
