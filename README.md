# wishlist
Some project ideas I'd work on if I had more free time/motivation. See other `.md` files and the lists below for detailed ideas and specifications.

## Useful
- Translate comments to english (ie - vscode translator extension)
- Automated tool that helps you migrate your code from github to codeberg or some other git hosting platform not owned by M$
- Convert this a github repo into a website that lets people contribute their own ideas and maybe add bounties too
- Chrome/firefix console for node.js so you can inspect complex objects
- Guestlist widget for website that has actual world map for where people live
- Water gun to spray washable paint on cars who drive through pedestrian crossway
- Preprocessor for TypeScript
- JavaScript library which converts objects into graphviz dot format
  - Even better if it would have a chrome style dropdown which lets you explore the objects' internals
- ifttt + scratch

## Useless but Interesting/funny
- Twitter bot that qrt "btw i use arch" every time someone mentions linux or arch linux
- OS that's just conway's game of life
- [anti-spellcheck](https://twitter.com/hoffridder/status/1362180211392065536): underlines words that are spelled correctly and gives most common mispellings
- `diff` except it always just says the entire file changed

## \[Bad] Startup ideas
- Tinder for e-dating
- Ransomware "insurance" - team to reinstall & recover everything (ie - for factories)
- Like Wikipedia but for [fake?] news

## Games
- Chemical factory game
- Racing game with an elo-system
